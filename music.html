<h2>DANCING Sun - Heart Tales</h2>
<p>As some of you might know, Graz has quite a vital alternative and indie music scene. One of its most outstanding proponents
  is Dancing Sun. <br> <br> <i>Meanwhile working on a concept album based upon Rudyard Kipling's Junglebook & works of Jakob Lorber 8
    personal ribbons of love & desire moved into the fore light of Dancing Sun.
    It is very possible that the Beatles on Acid would have released 'Heart Tales' if they had been windsurfing in Greece and been
    inspired by Carcass, King Crimson & Dead can Dance.
    After 'Firefable' has seen the light of the day Dancing Suns domain of tales prospected love minerals on the bench test of time.
    Celluloid & Cellulose songs ask hot potatoe questions such as 'Do we worship the same castle of the grail?' 'How can less be more?' &
    'How can a mongoose kill a cobra?' The answer is always the same: Fuck the Angst!
    Sometimes when the spoken word cannot provide a way for interaction communication there's an old vessel with its sails of poetry to set. This ship bears the name 'Heart Tales'.</i>
