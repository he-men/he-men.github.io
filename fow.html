    <p>The key issue of this Ted Talk, held by Daniel Susskind, is, that it is undeniably observable that there are clear changes in the
      world of work but it is less clear what those changes will be. One certain fact is that the problem of unemployment is real.
      Mister Susskind addresses three myths concerning the future of work to help us to better predict what it might be like:
      First, the so called terminator myth. Secondly he addresses the intelligence myth and finally Sussman talks about the superiority myth.
      It's a real nice ted talk. If you want to learn more about this topic, go checkout my portfolio - and click on the button below.
