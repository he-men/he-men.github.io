	<h3>LOREM IPSUM - or the story of the naked mole rat</h3>

	<ul id="loremStyle">

		<li>There can only be one (queen)<br><br>

			<ul>

				<li>Naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are what scientists call eusocial animals:
					adults live in groups and care for their young cooperatively, and only certain
					individuals get the privilege of producing those young. Ants and bees are more
					famous examples—the behavior is mostly seen among insects. There are only
					two mammalian species considered truly eusocial, and both are species of mole rat.
					So, yes: queen-bee-style, the most dominant mole rat ladies fight off
					competitors for the right to bear their colony’s young (while everyone
					else does the actual child-rearing) by, well, breeding as fast as possible.
					At the National Zoo, this struggle brought the adult brood down from 17
					to 13 over the course of a few months.
					“Yeah, they’ve been fighting and killing each other,” zookeeper Kenton
					Kearns told DCist. “They have mole-rat wars to determine who’s going to be
					the queen or who’s going to breed with the queen. We’re hoping things will
					calm down a little bit now.”
					It’s not surprising that this lady came out on top: she weighs 81 grams, and her
					second-closest competitor is just 55 grams. Her first litter included three pups, but she’s
					going to get pregnant again quickly—and as progressive pregnancies stretch out her spine (gross)
					she’ll grow to carry much larger broods.<br><br></li>
				</ul>

		<li>Queens can prevent puberty<br><br>

				<ul>

					<li>The mechanism behind this isn’t quite understood, but scientists have found that non-breeding
							females in a colony are actually infertile, with sexual organs that appear pre-pubescent.
							As soon as one of these ladies is shipped out on her own, she has a growth spurt and shows
							the signs of sexual maturity—as she perhaps prepares to stake her own claim as a baby-making queen..<br><br></li>
					</ul>

		<li>You should NOT challenge them to a breath-holding contest<br><br>

				<ul>

					<li>In a study published last year, scientists showed that naked mole rats can survive
							oxygen levels that “would be fatal to humans, and fatal to laboratory mice, and
							probably to everybody else.” At 5 percent oxygen—less than the atmosphere at the top of
							Mount Everest—researchers expected their squirmy subjects to display signs of distress
							within 15 minutes. But an hour later, they were fine.
							“After five hours, we were convinced that five percent oxygen is not a problem for these guys,
							so we decided to call it a night, go home, and have dinner,” Thomas Park of the University of
							Illinois, Chicago told PopSci in 2017. After five minutes in a container with zero oxygen, the
							animals passed out—but were back to normal a few seconds after release..<br><br></li>
				</ul>

			<li>They do eat their own poop<br><br>

				<ul>

					<li>Naked mole rats are known to scarf down feces to get any nutrients left to glean.
						Recent research suggests the queen’s poop might serve a greater purpose: It’s possible
				  	she feeds it to her workers in order to pass along the pregnancy hormones that predispose a new
						mother to care for her young. Since naked mole rat mamas don’t bother with babysitting their own
						offspring, they rely on others in the colony to protect the pups as if they were mothers themselves—
						and they do. It’s possible the poop provides a hormonal trigger. So if you find yourself in the midst
						of a naked mole rat coup, know this: if you lose, you’re going to get a lot of crap for it later. <i>(Source:
